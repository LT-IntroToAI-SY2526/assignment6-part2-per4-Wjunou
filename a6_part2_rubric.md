## Code Functionality (5 points)

Student should have completed all functions with working code:

- **`load_and_explore_data()`** - Loads CSV and prints summary statistics
- **`visualize_features()`** - Creates 4 subplots showing each feature vs Price
- **`prepare_features()`** - Correctly separates multiple features (X) from target (y)
- **`split_data()`** - Implements train/test split correctly
- **`train_model()`** - Trains model and prints all coefficients clearly
- **`evaluate_model()`** - Calculates R², RMSE, and shows feature importance
- **`compare_predictions()`** - Shows formatted table of actual vs predicted prices
- **`make_prediction()`** - Makes prediction for a new house

**Also consider:**
- Code follows good practices (comments, meaningful variable names)
- Code runs without errors
- Output is clear and easy to understand

---

## Visualizations (2 points)

Student should have created and saved `feature_plots.png` with:

- 4 subplots (SquareFeet, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Age vs Price)
- Clear axis labels on all plots
- Appropriate titles
- Professional appearance (grid, colors, layout)
- File successfully saved and committed to GitHub

---

## Writeup (3 points)

Student should have completed `a6_part2_writeup.md` with thoughtful answers to all 5 questions:

**Question 1:** Feature importance ranking with explanation
**Question 2:** Coefficient interpretation for two features
**Question 3:** R² score analysis and model performance
**Question 4:** Ideas for additional features to improve model
**Question 5:** Critical thinking about model trust and limitations

**Look for:**
- Complete sentences and thoughtful responses
- Demonstrates understanding of concepts (not just copying definitions)
- Critical thinking about real-world applications and limitations
